When the `static` keyword is applied to a variable, method, or class, it belongs to the class rather than a specific instance of the class.

### 1. Static Methods and Variables

We can access a static method or variable simply by putting the name of the class before the method or variable.

```
public class Snake {
    public static long hiss = 2;
}

...

System.out.println(Snake.hiss);     // 2
```

We can use an instance of the object as well, but it can be tricky. In the following example, Java looks at the type of the variable, instead of the object it is pointing to.

```
Snake s = new Snake();
System.out.println(s.hiss);         // s is a snake, it will output 2
s = null;
System.out.println(s.hiss);         // s is still a snake, it will output 2
```

When we update a static variable through an instance, it will update it in the class, therefore accessing it through another instance will produce the same
thing:

```
Snake.hiss = 4;
Snake snake1 = new Snake();
Snake snake2 = new Snake();
snake1.hiss = 6;
snake2.hiss = 5;
System.out.println(Snake.hiss);     // 5
```

### 2. Class vs. Instance Membership

A `static` member cannot call an instance member without referencing an instance of the class.

```
public class Gorilla {
    public static int count;

    public static void addGorilla() { count++; }

    public void babyGorilla() { count++; }

    public void announceBabies() {
        addGorilla();
        babyGorilla();
    }

    public static void announceBabiesToEveryone() {
        addGorilla();
        babyGorilla();                              // DOES NOT COMPILE, babyGorilla() is not static
    }

    public int total;

    public static double average = total / count;   // DOES NOT COMPILE, total is not static
}
```

### 3. Static Variable Modifiers

When a static variable is not meant to change, we need to use the `final` modifier (these variables are called _constants_). These variables
must be assigned a value when they are declared.

The rules for `static final` variables are similar to instance `final` variables, except they do not use `static` constructors
(there is no such thing), and use `static` initializers instead of instance initializers.

```
public class Panda {
    final static String name = "Ronda";
    static final int bamboo;
    static final double height;         // DOES NOT COMPILE
    static { bamboo = 5; };
}
```

### 4. Static Initializers

Instance initializers look like unnamed methods, which will be run when the instance gets initialized. Adding the `static` keyword to them will
run them when the class is first loaded.

```
private static int one;
private static final int two;
private static final int three = 3;
private static final int four;      // DOES NOT COMPILE

static {
    one = 1;
    two = 2;
    three 3;                        // DOES NOT COMPILE
    two = 4;                        // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```

### 5. Static Imports

Regular imports are for importing classes, while `static` imports are for importing `static` members of classes like variables and methods.

```
import java.util.List;
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;                  // static import
public class ZooParking {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = asList("one", "two");       // no Arrays. prefix
    }
}
```

Tricky examples:

```
import static java.util.Arrays;                 // DOES NOT COMPILE, classes cannot be imported in a static way
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;
static import java.util.Arrays.*;               // DOES NOT COMPILE, wrong order of keywords
public class BadZooParking {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Arrays.asList("one");                   // DOES NOT COMPILE, Arrays. prefix is not needed
    }
}
```

The compiler will complain if we try to explicitly do a `static` import of two methods or variables with the same name:

```
import static zoo.A.TYPE;
import static zoo.B.TYPE;                       // DOES NOT COMPILE
```
