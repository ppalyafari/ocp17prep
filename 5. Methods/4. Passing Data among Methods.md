### 1. Passing by Value

Java is a "pass-by-value" language, which means that a copy of the variable is made, and that's what the method receives. Assignments made
in the method do not affect the caller.

Example with primitives:

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int num = 4;
    newNumber(num);
    System.out.println(num);            // 4
}
public static void newNumber(int num) {
    num = 8;
}
```

Example with objects (assignment):

```
public class Dog {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Webby";
        speak(name);
        System.out.print(name);                 // Webby
    }
    public satic void speak(String name) {
        name = "Georgette";
    }
}
```

Example with objects (calling a method):

```
public class Dog {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var name = new StringBuilder("Webby");
        speak(name);
        System.out.print(name);                 // WebbyGeorgette
    }
    public static void speak(StringBuilder s) {
        s.append("Georgette");
    }
}
```

### 2. Autoboxing and Unboxing Variables

_Autoboxing_ is the process of converting a primitive into its equivalent wrapper class, while _unboxing_ is the process of converting a wrapper
class into its equivalent primitive.

```
int quack = 5;
Integer quackquack = quack;         // Autoboxing
int quackquackquack = quackquack;   // Unboxing
```

It is possible to do unboxing an implicit casting in the same step, but it is not possible to autobox and implicitly cast at the same time:

```
Integer e = Integer.valueOf(9);
long ears = e;                      // Unboxing, then implicit casting, since int can be stored in a long
Long badGorilla = 8;                // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

Tricky example, `null` cannot be assigned to a primitve:

```
Character elephant = null;
char badElephant = elephant;        // NullPointerException
```
