#### Introducting Abstract Classes

An _abstract class_ is a class declared with the `abstract` modifier that cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods.

```
public abstract class Canine {
    public abstract String getSound();
    public void bark() {System.out.println(getSound());}
}

public class Wolf extends Canine {
    public String getSound() {
        return "Wooof!";
    }
}
```

Rules:

- Only instance methods can be marked `abstract` within a class, not variables, constructors, or `static` methods.
- An abstract method can only be declared in an abstract class.
- A non-abstract class that exends an abstract class must implement all inherited abstract methods.
- Overriding an abstract method follows the existing rules for overriding methods that we learned about in the previous chapter.
- `abstract` cannot be used with `final`, `private`, or `static`

#### Declaring Abstract Methods

An abstract method is always declared without a body. It also includes a semicolon after the method declaration. They can only be declared
in abstract classes.

#### Creating a Concrete Class

A _concrete class_ is a non-abstract class. The first concrete subclass that extends an abstract class is requred to implement all inherited
abstract methods.

#### Creating Constructors in Abstract Classes

Even though abstract classes cannot be instantiated, they are still initialized through constructors by their subclasses.

```
abstract class Mammal {
    abstract CharSequence chew();
    public Mammal() {
        System.out.println(chew());     // this line compiles!
    }
}

public class Platypus extends Mammal {
    String chew() {return "yummy!";}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Platypus();
    }
}
```
