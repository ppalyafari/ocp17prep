### 1. Inheritance

_Inheritance_ is the process by which a subclass automatically includes certain members of the class, including primitives, objects, or methods, defined
in the parent class.

Any class that inherints from another class is referred to as a _subclass_ or _child class_, and the class it inherits from is the _superclass_ or
_parent class_.

Declaring a superclass and a subclass:

```
public class Mammal {}

public final class Rhinoceros extends Mammal {}
```

Key aspects of inheritance:

- Inheritance is **transitive**, which means that if X extends Y and Y extends Z, then X is considered a subclass or descendant of Z.
- All `public` and `protected` members are available to the child class.
- Only _single inheritance_ is supported, which means that a class may inherit from only one direct parent class.
- All classes inherit from the `Object` class

#### Class Modifiers

| Modifier   | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| final      | The class may not be extended.                                                                        |
| abstract   | The class is abstract, may contain abstract methods, and required a concrete subclass to instantiate. |
| sealed     | The class may only be extended by a specific list of classes.                                         |
| non-sealed | A subclass of a sealed class permits potentially unnamed subclasses.                                  |
| static     | Used for static nested classes defined within a class.                                                |

### 2. Creating Classes

#### Exending a Class

```
// Animal.java
public class Animal {
    private int age;
    protected String name;
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
    public void setAge(int newAge) {
        age = newAge;
    }
}

// Lion.java
public class Lion extends Animal {
    protected void setProperties(int age, String n) {
        setAge(age);
        name = n;
    }
    public void roar() {
        System.out.print(name + ", age " + getAge() + ", says: Roar!");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var lion = new Lion();
        lion.setProperties(3, "kion");
        lion.roar();                                        // kion, age 3, says: Roar!
    }
}
```

#### Applying Class Access Modifiers

Top level classes can be either `public`, or package protected, but not `protected` or `private`. Only nested classes can be `protected` or `private`.

```
// Bear.java
class Bird{}
class Bear{}
class Fish{}
```

```
// ClownFish.java
protected class ClownFish {}        // DOES NOT COMPILE

// BlueTang.java
private class BlueTang {}           // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

#### Accessing the this Reference

When we have a local variable with the same name as an instance variable, we need to use the `this` keyword to reference the instance variable.
The `this` keyword is otherwise optional. It can also be used to reference inherited members.

#### Calling the super Reference

A variable or method can be defined in both a parent class and a child class. This means the object instance actually holds two copies of the same
variable with the same underlying name. If we want to reference to a variable or method in the parent class, we need to use the `super` keyword.

#### Example for this and super

```
class Insect {
    protected int numberOfLegs = 4;
    String label = "buggy";

public class Beetle extends Insect {
    protected int numberOfLegs = 6;
    short age = 3;
    public void printData() {
        System.out.println(this.label);         // buggy
        System.out.println(super.label);        // buggy
        System.out.println(this.age);           // 3
        System.out.println(super.age);          // DOES NOT COMPILE
        System.out.println(numberOfLegs);       // 6
    }
    public static void main(String []n) {
        new Beetle().printData();
    }
}
}
```
