### 1. Components of Java

The _Java Development Kit (JDK)_ contains the minimum software we need to do Java development:

- `javac`: Converts .java source files into .class bytecode
- `java`: Executes the program
- `jar`: Packages files together
- `javadoc`: Generates documentation

In Java 8 and earlier, the _Java Runtime Environment (JRE)_ was a subset of the JDK, which was used for running a program,
but it could not compile one. Now, people can use the full JDK when running a Java program.

### 2. Understanding the Class Structure

In Java programs, classes are the building blocks. An _object_ is a runtime instance of a class in memory. An object is
often referred to as an _instance_ since it represents a single representation of the class. A _reference_ is a variable
that points to an object.

Java classes have two primary elements: **methods** and **fields**. Together these are called the **members** of the class.
Variables hold the state of the program, and methods operate on that state.

Example class with one field and two methods:

```
public class Animal {
String name;

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public void setName(String newName) {
            name = newName;
        }

    }
```

The method name and parameter types are called the **method signature**. For example, the method signature of the above
setter method is setName(String).

### 3. Comments

There are 3 types of comments:

1. Single-line comment: Ignores anything after the two slashes.

`// comment until end of line`

2. Multiple-line comment: Starts with a /_ and ends with a _/. The \* at the beginning of each line between these symbols
   is **not mandatory**.

```
/* Multiple
 * line comment
 */
```

3. Javadoc comment: Similar to a multiline comment, but it starts with a /\*\*. This is the type of comment the Javadoc tool
   knows how to read.

```
/**
 * Javadoc multiple
 * line
 * comment
 */
```

Tricky example:

```
/*
 * /* ferret */
 */
```

This one does not complie, since the comment ends at the end of the second line, therefore there is an extra \*/, which
is invalid syntax.
