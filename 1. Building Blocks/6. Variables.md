### 1. Identifiers

An _identifier_ is the name of a variable, method, class, interface or package. There are 4 rules for legal identifiers:

1. Identifiers must begin with a letter, a currency symbol, or a \_ symbol.
2. Identifiers can include numbers but not start with them.
3. A single underscore \_ is not allowed as an identifier.
4. Reserved words cannot be used

### 2. Declaring Multiple Variables

We can declare and initialize multiple variables in the same declaration as long as they are all of the same type.

`int num, String value; // DOES NOT COMPILE`

`double d1, double d2; // DOES NOT COMPILE, TYPE SHOULD APPEAR ONLY ONCE`

```
void paintFence() {
    int i1, i2, i3 = 0;
}
```

In the above example, we declared 3 variables, and initialized only one.

### 3. Initializing Variables

#### Local Variables

A _local_ variable is a variable defined within a constructor, method, or initializer block.

The **final** keyword can be applied to local variables and is equivalent to declaring constants in other languages.

```
final int y = 10;
int x = 20;
y = x + 10;         // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

The **final** modifier can also be applied to local variable references. The following example uses an `int[]` array object.

```
final int[] favoriteNumbers = new int[10];
favoriteNumbers[0] = 10;
favoriteNumbers = null;     // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

The content of the array can be modified even if it is final, but the value of the reference cannot be changed.

Local variables do not have a default value and must be initialized before use. The compiler will report an error if we try to use
an uninitialized value:

```
public int notValid() {
    int y = 10;
    int x;
    int reply = x + y;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
    return reply;
}
```

In case of if statements, we need to pay attention that the variable that is used after the statement will get initialized in all
of the branches.
