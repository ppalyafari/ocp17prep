### 1. Escape characters

The syntax \" lets us say a " rather than to end the String, and \n says we want a new line.

Example:

```
"Java Study Guide"
    by Scott & Jeanne
```

```
String eyeTest = "\"Java Study Guide\"\n    by Scott & Jeanne";
```

### 2. Textblocks

Instead of the above solution, we can use textblocks.

- Textblocks start and end with triple quotes: `"""`
- Opening triple quotes require a line break right after
- The contents don't need to be escaped
- If the closing quotes are placed on a new line, it will print an additional line (in case of the opening quotes, it won't)

**Essential whitespace**: These are part of our string
**Incidental whitespace**: Makes the code easier to read, but it isn't part of the string. Everything to the left of the
leftmost non-whitespace character is an incidental whitespaces, everything to the right is essential.

Example:

```
String pyramid = """
  *
 * *
* * *
""";
System.out.println(pyramid);
```

The above will generate 4 lines, and there are no incidental whitespaces.
