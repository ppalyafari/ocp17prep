All Java objects are stored in the program's memory _heap_. The heap, or _free store_ represents a large pool of unused memory
allocated to the Java application.

_Garbage collection_ refers to the process of automatically freeing memory on the heap by deleting objects that are no longer
reachable in the program. Once an object is eligible for garbage collection, the collection is **not** going to happen immediately.

Java includes a method to help support garbage collection, but it is not guaranteed to do anything:

`System.gc();`

An object is no longer reachable when one of the two situations occurs:

1. The object no longer has any references pointing to it
2. All references to the object have gone out of scope
