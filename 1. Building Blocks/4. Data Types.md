### 1. Primitive Types

Java has 8 build-in data types, referred to as the Java _primitive types_. All Java objects are just a complex collection of these
primitive data types. A primitive is just a single value in memory, such as a number or character.

| Keyword | Type                        | Min value      | Max value     | Default value | Example |
| ------- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| boolean | true or false               | n/a            | n/a           | false         | true    |
| byte    | 8-bit integral value        | -128           | 127           | 0             | 123     |
| short   | 16-bit integral value       | -32,768        | 32,767        | 0             | 123     |
| int     | 32-bit integral value       | -2,147,483,648 | 2,147,483,647 | 0             | 123     |
| long    | 64-bit integral value       | -2^63          | 2^63 - 1      | 0L            | 123L    |
| float   | 32-bit floating point value | n/a            | n/a           | 0.0f          | 123.45f |
| double  | 64-bit floating point value | n/a            | n/a           | 0.0           | 123.456 |
| char    | 16-bit Unicode value        | 0              | 65,535        | \u0000        | 'a'     |

- A `float` requires the letter f or F following the number so Java knows it is a `float`. Without an f or F, Java interprets a
  decimal value as a `double`.
- A `long` requires the letter l or L following the number so Java knows it is a `long`. Without an l or L, Java interprets a number
  without a decimal point as an `int` in most scenarios.
- The bit size of a `boolean` is not specified, and is dependent on the JVM where the code is being executed.
