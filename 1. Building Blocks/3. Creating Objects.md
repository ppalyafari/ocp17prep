### 1. Constructors

To create an instance of a class, we need to call its constructor:

`Park p = new Park()` <- Park() is a _constructor_.

There are two key points to note about the constructor:

1. The **name of the constructor** matches the **name of the class**
2. There is no return type

```
public class Chick() {
    public void Chick() {} // NOT A CONSTRUCTOR
}
```

The above is a regular method, which compiles but it will not be called when we write `new Chick()`.

Another way to initialize fields is to do so directly on the line on which they're declared. This example shows
both approaches:

```
public class Chichken {
    int numEggs = 12; // initialize on line
    String name;

    public Chicken() {
        name = "Duke"; // initialize in constructor
    }
}
```

### 2. Reading and Writing Member Fields

It is possible to read and write instance variables directly from the caller:

```
public class Swan {
    int numberEggs;                             // instance variable
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Swan mother = new Swan();
        mother.numberEggs = 1;                  // set variable
        System.out.println(mother.numberEggs);  // read variable
    }
}
```

### 3. Instance Initializers

Instance initializers are code blocks that appear outside a method.

```
public class Bird {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        {System.out.println("Feathers");}       // this is not an instance initializer
    }

    {System.out.println("Snowy);}               // this is an instance initializer
}
```

### 4. Order of Initialization

- Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in which they apear in the file.
- The constructor runs after all fields and instance initializer blocks have run.

Example:

```
public class Chick {
    private String name = "Fluffy";
    { System.out.println("setting field");}

    public Chick() {
        name = "Tiny";
        System.out.println("setting constructor");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Chick chick = new Chick();
        System.out.println(chich.name);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
setting field
setting constructor
Tiny
```
