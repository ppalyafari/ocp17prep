### 1. Assigning Values

The simplest assignment operator is the = assignment, for example, the following statement assigns the `herd` variable
the value 1.

`int herd = 1;`

#### Casting

_Casting_ is a unary operation where one data type is explicitly interpreted as another data type. Casting is optional and
unnecessary when converting to a larger data type, but it is required when converting to a smaller data type. Without casting,
the compiler will generate an error when trying to put a larger data type inside a smaller one.

Some examples of casting:

```
short tail = (short)(4+10);
int hair = (short) 2;
long feathers = 10(long); // DOES NOT COMPILE
float egg = 2.0 / 9;      // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

_Overflow_: when a number is so large that it will no longer fit within the data type, so the system wraps around to the lowerst
negative value and counts up from there.
_Underflow_: when the number is too low to fit in the data type, such as storing -200 in a byte field.

#### Casting Values vs. Variables

```
short gloves = 2 + 1;
byte hat = 1;
short boots = 2 + hat; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

In the above example, hat is first cast to int, adds it to 2, so the result is an int instead of a short.

#### Compound Assignment Operators

| Operator                  | Example   | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Addition assignment       | a += 5    | Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the sum to the variable.            |
| Subtraction assignment    | a -= 5    | Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the difference to the variable. |
| Multiplication assignment | a \*= 100 | Multiplies the value on the right with the variable on the left and assigns the product to the variable.   |
| Division assignment       | a /= 4    | Divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the quotient to the variable.       |

In case of using compound operators, we don't have to explicitly cast a value:

```
long goat = 20;
int sheep = 5;
sheep = sheep * goat; // DOES NOT COMPILE, TRYING TO ASSIGN A LONG TO AN INT

long goat = 10;
int sheep = 5;
sheep *= goat; // SHEEP WILL BE CAST TO LONG, THEN IT WILL BE MULTIPLIED, THEN IT WILL BE CAST TO AN INT
```

#### Return Value of Assignment Operators

The result of an assignment is an expression in and of itself equal to the value of the assignment.

```
long coyote = (wolf=3);
System.out.println(wolf);   // 3
```

### 2. Comparing Values

#### Equality Operators

| Operator   | Example   | Apply to primitives                                       | Apply to objects                                                |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equality   | a == 10   | Returns true if the two values represent the same value   | Returns true if the two values reference the same object        |
| Inequality | b != 3.14 | Returns true if the two values represent different values | Returns true if the two values do not reference the same object |

The equality operator can be applied to numeric values, boolean values, and objects (including null).
Tricky examples:

```
boolean monkey = true == 3;         // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean ape = false != "Grape";     // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

For object comparison, the equality operator is applied to the references to the objects, not the objects they point to.
Two references are **equal if and only if they point to the same object or both point to null**.

```
var monday = new File("schedule.txt");
var tuesday = new File("schedule.txt");
var wednesday = tuesday;
System.out.println(monday == tuesday);      // FALSE
System.out.println(tuesday == wednesday);   // TRUE
```

#### Relational Operators

| Operator                 | Example             | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Less than                | a < 5               | Returns true if the value on the left is strictly less than the value on the right                                                       |
| Less than or equal to    | b <= 6              | Returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right                                                    |
| Greater than             | c > 9               | Returns true if the value on the left is strictly greater than the value on the right                                                    |
| Greater than or equal to | 3 >= d              | Returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right                                                 |
| Type comparison          | e instanceof String | Returns true if the reference on the left side is an instance of the type on the right side (class, interface, record, enum, annotation) |

Examples for `instanceof`:

```
public void openZoo(Number time) {
    if (time instanceof Integer)
        System.out.println((Integer)time + "O'clock");
    else
        System.out.println(time);
}
```

Invalid examples:

Number cannot possibly hold a String value:

```
public void openZoo(Number time) {
    if(time instanceof String)      // DOES NOT COMPILE
        System.out.println(time);
}
```

null and the instanceof operator:

```
System.out.println(null instanceof Object); // FALSE
System.out.println(null instanceof null)l   // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

#### Logical Operators

| Operator             | Example | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Logical AND          | a & b   | Value is true only if both values are true                   |
| Logical inclusive OR | c \| d  | Value is true if at least one of the values is true          |
| Logical exclusive OR | e ^ f   | Value is true only if one value true and the other is false. |

#### Conditional Operators

| Operator        | Example  | Description                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contitional AND | a && b   | Value is true only if both values are true. If the left side is false, then the right side will not be evaluated.         |
| Conditional OR  | c \|\| d | Value is true if at least one of the values is true. If the left side is true, then the right side will not be evaluated. |

Avoiding a NullPointerException:

```
if(duck!=null & duck.getAge()<5) {  // COULD THROW A NPE
    // DO SOMETHING
}

if(duck!=null && duck.getAge()<5) {
    // DO SOMETHING
}
```

Unperformed Side Effects:

```
int rabbit = 6;
boolean bunny = (rabbit >= 6) || (++rabbit <= 7);
System.out.println(rabbit); // 6
```

Since rabbit is 6, the increment operator on the right side is never evaluated.
