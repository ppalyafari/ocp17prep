### 1. Assigning Values

The simplest assignment operator is the = assignment, for example, the following statement assigns the `herd` variable
the value 1.

`int herd = 1;`

#### Casting

_Casting_ is a unary operation where one data type is explicitly interpreted as another data type. Casting is optional and
unnecessary when converting to a larger data type, but it is required when converting to a smaller data type. Without casting,
the compiler will generate an error when trying to put a larger data type inside a smaller one.

Some examples of casting:

```
short tail = (short)(4+10);
int hair = (short) 2;
long feathers = 10(long); // DOES NOT COMPILE
float egg = 2.0 / 9;      // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

_Overflow_: when a number is so large that it will no longer fit within the data type, so the system wraps around to the lowerst
negative value and counts up from there.
_Underflow_: when the number is too low to fit in the data type, such as storing -200 in a byte field.

#### Casting Values vs. Variables

```
short gloves = 2 + 1;
byte hat = 1;
short boots = 2 + hat; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

In the above example, hat is first cast to int, adds it to 2, so the result is an int instead of a short.

#### Compound Assignment Operators

| Operator                  | Example   | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Addition assignment       | a += 5    | Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the sum to the variable.            |
| Subtraction assignment    | a -= 5    | Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the difference to the variable. |
| Multiplication assignment | a \*= 100 | Multiplies the value on the right with the variable on the left and assigns the product to the variable.   |
| Division assignment       | a /= 4    | Divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the quotient to the variable.       |

In case of using compound operators, we don't have to explicitly cast a value:

```
long goat = 20;
int sheep = 5;
sheep = sheep * goat; // DOES NOT COMPILE, TRYING TO ASSIGN A LONG TO AN INT

long goat = 10;
int sheep = 5;
sheep *= goat; // SHEEP WILL BE CAST TO LONG, THEN IT WILL BE MULTIPLIED, THEN IT WILL BE CAST TO AN INT
```

#### Return Value of Assignment Operators

The result of an assignment is an expression in and of itself equal to the value of the assignment.

```
long coyote = (wolf=3);
System.out.println(wolf);   // 3
```

### 2. Comparing Values

#### Equality Operators

| Operator   | Example   | Apply to primitives                                       | Apply to objects                                                |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equality   | a == 10   | Returns true if the two values represent the same value   | Returns true if the two values reference the same object        |
| Inequality | b != 3.14 | Returns true if the two values represent different values | Returns true if the two values do not reference the same object |
