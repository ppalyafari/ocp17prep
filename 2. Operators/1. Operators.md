### 1. Unary Operators

| Operator           | Examples  | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logical complement | !a        | Inverts a boolean's logical value                                                            |
| Bitwise complement | ~b        | Inverts all 0s and 1s in a number (simplified: multiply it by negative one and subtract one) |
| Plus               | +c        | Indicates a number is positive                                                               |
| Minus              | -d        | Indicates a numer is negative or negates an expression                                       |
| Pre-increment      | ++w       | Increases the value by 1 and returns the new value                                           |
| Pre-decrement      | --w       | Decreases the value by 1 and returns the new value                                           |
| Post-increment     | w++       | Increases the value by 1 and returns the original value                                      |
| Post-decrement     | w--       | Decreases the value by 1 and returns the original value                                      |
| Cast               | (String)i | Casts a value to a specific type                                                             |

Tricky examples:

```
int pelican = !5;           // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean penguin = -true;    // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean peacock = !0;       // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

### 2. Binary Operators

| Operator       | Example | Description                                                          |
| -------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Addition       | a + b   | Adds two numeric values                                              |
| Subtraction    | a - b   | Subtracts two numeric values                                         |
| Multiplication | a \* b  | Multiplies two numeric values                                        |
| Division       | a / b   | Divides one numeric value by other                                   |
| Modulus        | a % b   | Returns the remainder after division of one numeric value by another |

### 3. Numeric Promotion

1. If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values to the larger of the two
   data types.
2. If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java will automatically promote the integral value
   to the floating-point value's data type.
3. Smaller data types, namely, byte, short, and char, are first promoted to int any time they're used with a Java binary
   arithmetic operator with a variable (as opposed to a value), even if neither of the operands is int.
4. After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting value will have the same data
   type as its promoted operands.

Examples

```
int x = 1;
long y = 33;
var z = x + y; <- this will be long
```

```
double x = 39.21;
float y = 2.1;
var z = x + y; <- this will be double, since f is missing from the end of y
```

```
short x = 10;
short y = 3;
var z = x + y; <- this will be int
```

```
short w = 14;
float x = 13;
double y = 30;
var z = x + x / y; <- this will be double
```
