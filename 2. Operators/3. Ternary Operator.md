The ternary operator has the following form:
`booleanExpression ? expression1 : expression2`

The first operand must be a boolean expression, and the second and third operands can be any expression that returns a value.

```
int owl = 5;
int food = owl < 2 ? 3 : 4;
System.out.println(food);   // 4
```
