There are 2 types of `for` loops:

1. the _basic_ `for` loop
2. the _enhanced_ `for` (`for-each`) loop

### 1. The `for` loop

Structure for a basic for loop:

```
for(initialization; booleanExpression; updateStatement) {       // braces are optional for single statements
    // body
}
```

Order of execution:

1. Initialization statement
2. If booleanExpression is true, continue, else exit loop
3. Body executes
4. Execute updateStatement
5. Return to step 2

Variables declared before the loop can be used:

```
int i = 10;
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println("Value is: " + i);
System.out.println(i);
}
```

`var` can also be used:

```
for(var counter = 5; counter > 0; counter--) {
    System.out.println(counter + " ");
}
```

### Examples

**Creating an infinite loop**

Each component of the `for` loop is optional, so this compiles"

```
for( ; ;)
    System.out.println("Hello world");
```

**Adding Multiple Terms to the for statement**

Multiple variables can be used in the initialization/boolean/update statements:

```
int x = 0;
for(long y = 0, z = 4; x < 5 && y < 10; x++, y++) {
    System.out.println(y + " ");
}
System.out.println(x + " ");
```

**Redeclaring a variable in the initialization block**

We cannot use an already declared variable in the initialization statement:

```
int x = 0;
for(int x = 4; x < 5; x++)      // DOES NOT COMPILE
    System.out.print(x + " ");
```

**Using incompatible data types in the initialization block**

The variables in the initialization block must be all of the same type:

```
int x = 0;
for(long y = 0, int z = 4; x < 5; x++)      // DOES NOT COMPILE
    System.out.print(y + " ");
```

**Using loop variables outside the loop**

```
for(long y = 0, x = 4; x < 5 && y < 10; x++, y++)
    System.out.print(y + " ");
System.out.print(x);            // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

### 2. The for-each loop

Structure of the for-each loop:

```
for (datatype instance: collection) {   // braces are optional for single statements
    // body
}
```

The for-each loop declaration is composed of an initialization section and an bject to be iterated over.
The right side of the for-each loop must be one of the following:

- A build-in Java array
- An object whose type implements `java.lang.Iterable`, for example `List` or `Set`. This does not include all of the
  Collections Framework classes or interfaces, but only those that implement or extend the `Collection` interface (for example,
  `Map` is not supported)

The left side of the for-each loop must include a declaration for an instance of a variable whose type is compatible with the
type of the array or collection on the right side of the statement.

```
public void printNames(String[] names) {
    for (var name : names)
        System.out.println(name);
}
```

**Examples**

The following examples does not compile, because `String` does not implement the `Iterable` interface.

```
String birds = "Jay";
for(String bird : birds)    // DOES NOT COMPILE
    System.out.print(bird + " ");
```

The following example does not compile, because the left side of the statement is `int` and doesn't match the expected type of
`String`.

```
String[] sloths = new String[3];
for(int sloth : sloths)         // DOES NOT COMPILE
    System.out.print(sloth + " ");
```
