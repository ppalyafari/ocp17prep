The simplest repetitive control structure in Java is the `while` statement. The `while` loop has two forms:

1. Simple `while` statement
2. `do/while` statement

### 1. The while statement

Like all repetition control structures, it has a termination condition, implemented as a `boolean` expression, that
will continue as long as the expression evaluates to `true`.

During execution, the `boolean` expression is evaluated before each iteration fo the loop and exits if the evaluation
returns `false`.

```
while(booleanExpression) {  // braces are optional for single statements
    // body
}
```

### 2. Do/while statement

Unlike a `while` loop, a `do/while` loop gurarantees that the statement or block will be executed at least once.

```
do {         // braces are optional for single statements
    // body
} while(booleanExpression);
```
