#### Declaring and Using an Interface

An _interface_ is an abstract data type that declares a list of abstract methods that any class implementing the interface must provide.

```
public abstract interface CanBurrow {
    public abstract Float getSpeed(int age);        // abstract interface method

    public static final int MINIMUM_DEPTH = 2;      // constant variable
}
```

Interface variables are referred to as constants because they are assumed to be `public`, `static`, and `final`. They are initialized with a
constant value when they are declared. Since they are `public` and `static`, they can be used outside the interface declaration without
requiring an instance of the interface.

An interface is always considered to be `abstract`, even if it is not marked so, therefore they cannot be `final`.

**Implementing an Interface:**

```
public class FieldMouse implements Climb, CanBurrow {
    public Float getSpeed(int age){
        return 11f;
    }
}
```

Unlike a class, which can extend only one class, interfaces can extend multiple interfaces:

```
public interface Nocturnal{
    public int hunt();
}

public interface CanFly {
    public void flap();
}

public interface HasBigEyes extends Nocturnal, CanFly {
    public int hunt() {return 5;}
    public void flap() {System.out.println("Flap");}
}
```

When a concrete class inherits an interface, all of the inherited abstract methods must be implemented:

```
abstract class Animal {
    abstract int getType();
}

abstract class Bird implements Fly{
    abstract boolean canSwoop();
}

interface Fly {
    void fly();
}

interface Swim {
    void swim();
}

class Swan extends Bird, implements Swim {
    // must implement all 4 methods
}
```

#### Inheriting Duplicate Abstract Methods

Java supports inheriting two abstract methods that have compatible method declarations. By compatible, we mean a method
can be written that properly overrides both inherited methods.

**Example for compatible:**

```
public interface Herbivore { publc void eatPlants(); }

public interface Omnivore { public void eatPlants(); }

public class Bear implements Herbivore, Omnivore {
    public void eatPlants(){
        System.out.println("Eating plants".);
    }
}
```

**Example for incompatible:**

```
public interface Herbivore { publc void eatPlants(); }

public interface Omnivore { public int eatPlants(); }

public class Bear implements Herbivore, Omnivore {      // DOES NOT COMPILE
    ...
}
```

#### Implicit Modifiers

- Interfaces are implicitly abstract
- Interface variables are implicitly public, static, and final.
- Interface methods without a body are implicitly abstract.
- Interface methods without the private modifier are implicitly public.

#### Declaring Concrete Interface Methods

|                       | Membership type | Required modifiers | Implicit modifiers    | Has value or body? |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Constant variable     | Class           | -                  | public, static, final | Yes                |
| abstract method       | Instance        | -                  | public, abstract      | No                 |
| default method        | Instance        | default            | public                | Yes                |
| static method         | Class           | static             | public                | Yes                |
| private method        | Instance        | private            | -                     | Yes                |
| private static method | Class           | private, static    | -                     | Yes                |

#### Writing a Default Interface Method

A _default method_ is a method defined in an interface with the `default` keyword and includes a method body. It may be optionally
overridden by a class implementing the interface.

**Default Interface Method Definition Rules:**

1. A `default` method may be be declared only within an interface.
2. A `default` method must be marked with the `default` keyword and include a method body.
3. A `default` method is implicitly `public`.
4. A `default` method cannot be marked `abstract`, `final`, or `static`.
5. A `default` method may be overridden by a class that implements the interface.
6. If a class inherits two or more `default` methods with the same method signature, then the class must override the method.

**Calling a hidden default method:**

```
public interface Walk {
    public default int getSpeed() {return 5;}
}

public class Cat implements Walk {
    public int getSpeed()
    {
        return 1;
    }

    public int getWalkSpeed() {
        return Walk.super.getSpeed();
    }
}
```

#### Static Interface Methods

**Static Interface Definition Rules**

1. A `static` method must be marked with the `static` keyword and include a method body.
2. A `static` method without an access modifier is implicitly `public`.
3. A `static` method cannot be marked `abstract` or `final`.
4. A `static` method is not inherited and cannot be accessed in a class implementing the interface without a reference to the interface
   name.

#### Private Interface Methods

**Private Interface Method Definition Rules**

1. A `private` interface method must be marked with the `private` modifier and include a method body.
2. A `private static` interface method may be called by any method within the interface definition.
3. A `private` interface method may only be called by `default` and other `private` non-`static` methods within the interface definition.

#### Interface Member Access

- Treat `abstract`, `default`, and non-`static private` methods as belonging to an instance of the interface.
- Treat `static` methods and variables as belonging to the interface class object.
- All `private` interface method types are only accessible within the interface declaration.
