#### Declaring and Using an Interface

An _interface_ is an abstract data type that declares a list of abstract methods that any class implementing the interface must provide.

```
public abstract interface CanBurrow {
    public abstract Float getSpeed(int age);        // abstract interface method

    public static final int MINIMUM_DEPTH = 2;      // constant variable
}
```

Interface variables are referred to as constants because they are assumed to be `public`, `static`, and `final`. They are initialized with a
constant value when they are declared. Since they are `public` and `static`, they can be used outside the interface declaration without
requiring an instance of the interface.

An interface is always considered to be `abstract`, even if it is not marked so, therefore they cannot be `final`.

**Implementing an Interface:**

```
public class FieldMouse implements Climb, CanBurrow {
    public Float getSpeed(int age){
        return 11f;
    }
}
```

Unlike a class, which can extend only one class, interfaces can extend multiple interfaces:

```
public interface Nocturnal{
    public int hunt();
}

public interface CanFly {
    public void flap();
}

public interface HasBigEyes extends Nocturnal, CanFly {
    public int hunt() {return 5;}
    public void flap() {System.out.println("Flap");}
}
```

When a concrete class inherits an interface, all of the inherited abstract methods must be implemented:

```
abstract class Animal {
    abstract int getType();
}

abstract class Bird implements Fly{
    abstract boolean canSwoop();
}

interface Fly {
    void fly();
}

interface Swim {
    void swim();
}

class Swan extends Bird, implements Swim {
    // must implement all 4 methods
}
```

#### Inheriting Duplicate Abstract Methods

Java supports inheriting two abstract methods that have compatible method declarations. By compatible, we mean a method
can be written that properly overrides both inherited methods.

**Example for compatible:**

```
public interface Herbivore { publc void eatPlants(); }

public interface Omnivore { public void eatPlants(); }

public class Bear implements Herbivore, Omnivore {
    public void eatPlants(){
        System.out.println("Eating plants".);
    }
}
```

**Example for incompatible:**

```
public interface Herbivore { publc void eatPlants(); }

public interface Omnivore { public int eatPlants(); }

public class Bear implements Herbivore, Omnivore {      // DOES NOT COMPILE
    ...
}
```

#### Implicit Modifiers

- Interfaces are implicitly abstract
- Interface variables are implicitly public, static, and final.
- Interface methods without a body are implicitly abstract.
- Interface methods without the private modifier are implicitly public.
