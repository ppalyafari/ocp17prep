### 1. Equality

1. Calling the `equals()` on an object will call the implemented `equals()` method and will compare the values based on its logic,
   while using `==` will compare the object references.
2. If a class doesn't have an `equals()` method, Java determines whether the references point to the same object, which is the same as `==` (`StringBuilder`
   doesn't have one for example).

```
var one = new StringBuilder();
var two = new StringBuilder();
var three = one.append("a");
System.out.println(one == two);     // false
System.out.println(one == three);   // true
```

```
var x = "Hello World";
var z = " Hello World".trim();
System.out.println(x.equals(z));    // true
```

The compiler knows that two references cannot possibly point to the same object when they are completely different types:

```
var name = "a";
var builder = new StringBuilder("a");
System.out.println(name == builder);        // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

#### Overriding the toString(), equals(Object), and hashCode()

- `toString()`: This method is called when we try to print an object or concatenate the object with a `String`.
- `equals(Object)`: This method is used to compare objects, with the default implementation using the == operator. We should override
  this method any time we want to conveniently compare elements for equality, especially if this requires numerous fields.
- `hashCode()`: Any time we override the `equals(Object)` we must override the `hashCode()` to be consistent. This means that for any two
  objects, if `a.equals(b)` is true, then `a.hashCode()==b.hashCode()` must also be true. If they are not consistent, this could lead to
  invalid data and side effects in hash-based collections such as `HashMap` and `HashSet`.

### 2. The String Pool

The string pool contains literal values and constants in order to make the program more efficient. For example, `"name"` is a literal and therefore
goes into the string pool. The `myObject.toString()` method returns a string but not a literal, so it does not go into the string pool.

Example 1:

```
var x = "Hello World";
var y = "Hello World";
System.out.println(x == y);     // true
```

Example 2:

```
var x = "Hello World";
var z = " Hello World".trim();
System.out.println(x == z);     // false, because z is computed at runtime
```

Example 3:

```
var singleString = "hello world";
var concat = "hello ";
concat += "world";
System.out.println(singleString == concat);     // false, because += also returns a new String
```

The `intern()` method tells Java to use the string pool:

```
var name = "Hello World";
var name2 = new String("Hello World").intern();
System.out.println(name == name2);              // true
```

Example 4 (usage of `intern()`):

```
var first = "rat" + 1;                          // goes to string pool
var second = "r" + "a" + "t" + "1";             // goes to string pool
var third = "r" + "a" + "t" + new String("1");
System.out.println(first == second);            // true
System.out.println(first == second.intern());   // true
System.out.println(first == third);             // false
System.out.println(first == third.intern());    // true
```
